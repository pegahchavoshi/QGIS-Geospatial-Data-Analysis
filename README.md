# QGIS Geospatial Data Analysis and Visualization


## Overview

In this project, I completed a GIS analysis project where I applied various techniques and tools to analyze geospatial data and created a detailed map.

To accomplish this, I utilized the QGIS software and explored its interface to perform a range of tasks. I employed both vector and raster data, working with diverse data formats and sources. Additionally, I installed and utilized plugins to extend the functionality of QGIS, enabling more advanced analysis and visualization options.

Throughout the project, I employed techniques such as spatial queries, overlay analysis, and geoprocessing tools to extract meaningful insights from the data. These techniques allowed me to identify spatial patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset. I also applied data styling and symbology techniques to effectively represent the analyzed information on the map.

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to utilize QGIS, a powerful open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, to conduct spatial analysis and create visualizations for urban planning. The project involves working with vector and raster data, installing plugins, styling and exporting vector files, creating maps, and exporting data in various formats.

### Objectives

1. Conduct spatial analysis to identify areas of interest and key features in the study area.
2. Visualize and analyze vector data, including polygons and points representing areas of interest and relevant infrastructure.
3. Style vector layers to enhance visual representation and extract meaningful information.
4. Incorporate OpenStreetMap data to provide context and additional information.
5. Work with raster data to visualize and analyze elevation and land cover.
6. Create maps with customized layouts and export them for presentation purposes.
7. Export data in different formats, such as shapefiles and KML, for further analysis and integration with other software.
